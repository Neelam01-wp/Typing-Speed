# Typing Speed Test

This project is a simple typing speed test web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  It allows users to test their typing speed and accuracy.

## Project Files:

* `index.html`:  The main HTML file containing the structure and content of the webpage.
* `styles.css`: The CSS file responsible for styling the webpage's layout and visual appearance.
* `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the logic for the typing test, including timer functionality, accuracy calculation, and result display.


## Functionality:

The Typing Speed Test application presents the user with a sample text passage.  The user types the passage, and the application measures:

* **Words Per Minute (WPM):** The number of words typed correctly per minute.
* **Accuracy:** The percentage of correctly typed words.
* **Time Taken:** The time taken to complete the typing test.


Upon completion of the test (by pressing Enter or when the user reaches the end of the text), the application displays the WPM, accuracy, and time taken.


## HTML Features Used:

* **Structure:**  Uses semantic HTML elements like `<div>`, `<p>`, `<span>` to structure the webpage content.
* **Input:** Employs `<input type="text">` for user input.
* **Display:** Uses various HTML elements to display the test passage, timer, and results.


## CSS Features Used:

* **Layout:** Uses CSS properties like `display`, `flex`, `grid`, `padding`, and `margin` to create the webpage's layout and arrange elements.
* **Styling:** Uses CSS properties to style the text, background, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance.  This includes setting styles for different states (e.g., correct/incorrect words).
* **Responsiveness:**  (Optional, depending on implementation) Might include media queries to ensure the application adapts well to different screen sizes.


## JavaScript Features Used:

* **Event Handling:** Uses event listeners (e.g., `addEventListener`) to detect user input (keystrokes) and the completion of the test.
* **Timer:** Implements a timer using `setInterval` or `setTimeout` to track the time elapsed.
* **String Manipulation:** Uses string methods (e.g., `split`, `trim`, `toLowerCase`) to process the user's input and compare it to the sample text.
* **Calculation:** Performs calculations to determine WPM and accuracy.
* **DOM Manipulation:** Uses DOM methods to update the webpage content dynamically (e.g., displaying the timer, results, and highlighting correct/incorrect words).


## How to Run:

1. Make sure you have a web browser installed.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.


## Future Enhancements (Optional):

* Implement a practice mode with different difficulty levels.
* Store high scores using local storage.
* Add more sample texts.
* Create a user interface for selecting different text passages.
* Implement visual feedback (e.g., highlighting incorrectly typed words).


This README provides a general overview.  Specific details of the implementation will be found in the code itself.
